# Multiplayer-Dice-Game
The Dice Game Tournament Simulator is a Python program that simulates a multi-player dice game over 10+ rounds. Players earn points based on dice rolls, with special rules for rolling 1s, 6s, and penalties. It uses loops, conditionals, and lambda functions to track scores and determine the winner.
